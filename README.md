# Byzantine Fault Tracing
This is currently a work in progress repo for our seventh semester research project, under Prof H.B Prasad. 
# Title:
Novel Algorithm for Byzantine Fault Tracing using memory traces and blockchain
# Abstract:
A novel algorithm for Byzantine Fault Tracing on distributed services, using blockchain and code execution profiling. The blockchain acts as the interface between the public and private network. The private network consists of the distributed servers, and the code consists of certain critical sections. It is these sections, whoâ€™s execution profile is stored on the node of the blockchain. We face the following issues and aim to solve them:
- Handling changes to deployment
- Handling both read and write attacks
- Handling malfunctions not just adversaries

The following showcases how the different graphs look with and without anomalies:
### With anomalies

### Normal Execution (without anomalies)
